## 🚀 End-to-End Workflows

### User Story 1: Generate Workspace Structure

```bash
# 1. Create workspace
POST /v1/workspaces
{
  "name": "Acme Corp",
  "slug": "acme-corp",
  "type": "company"
}

# 2. Start structure generation
POST /v1/structure/generate
{
  "workspaceId": "<workspace-id>",
  "communitySize": "medium",
  "coreActivities": ["engineering", "design"],
  "moderationCapacity": "moderate",
  "channelBudget": 15
}

# → AI generates proposal

# 3. Review proposal (returned immediately)
{
  "channels": [
    { "name": "general", "type": "core" },
    { "name": "announcements", "type": "core" },
    { "name": "random", "type": "core" }
  ],
  "rationale": "..."
}

# 4. Approve and apply
POST /v1/structure/proposals/:jobId/approve

# → Channels created in workspace!
```

### User Story 2: File Hub with AI

```bash
# 1. Create file sync job
POST /v1/workspaces/:id/files/sync

# 2. File added (simulated - real version would sync from Google Drive)
# Manually insert for now

# 3. AI tag the file
POST /v1/files/:fileId/tag
→ { "tags": ["product", "roadmap", "2025"], "category": "product-management" }

# 4. Index for search
POST /v1/files/:fileId/index
→ Embedding generated and stored

# 5. Search
GET /v1/files/search?q=roadmap&tags=product
→ Returns matching files
```

## 🚀 What's Next: Phase 5

**Phase 5: Frontend Integration**

Will do:
1. Create API client in frontend
2. Wire up authentication
3. Connect workspace switcher
4. Connect messaging to WebSocket
5. Connect Structure Wizard to real API
6. Connect File Hub to real API
7. Add feature flag toggle
8. Remove/replace localStorage mocks

**Goal:** Frontend uses real backend, no more mocks!

---
